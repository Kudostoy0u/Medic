Problems and Solutions in HealthCare 
<h1>

<h2 style = "padding:50px; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; text-align:center; font-size: 33.5px;">
<ul>Currrently, the cost for healthcare is very expensive! According to SingleCare, the average price for insulin, per month, is over $1000. Health insurance can run you about $550 per month. Drug costs are also rising; according to investopedia, drug costs in the US are more than 250% more expensive than those in other countries. The eligibility for government assistance healthcare programs, such Medicare, is very low. This may mean that getting a raise can actually cost you and make you ineligble for goverment funding. <br> </ul>
According to WHO (World Health Organization) only over 3 perecent of the population in low-income families had been vaccinated. This is in comparsion to the 60 percent of people who have recieved the vaccine in high-income countries. The number of vaccines administered has been going up rapidly, although the inequality in distribution has aswell. Out of the 10 billion of vaccines that were given out worldwide, less than one percent of that number went to low-income countries. <br> 
    
<br>
By raising awareness to the issue of problems in the industry, people around the world who were once oblivious to this issue, can join forces and help fight this modern problem. Fundraisers and social change movements not only relieve the current need for reform, but also provide better and healthier planet Earth. <br>
    <br>
    The healthcare industry needs to change!
