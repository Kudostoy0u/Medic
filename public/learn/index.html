<ul>Currrently, the cost for healthcare is very expensive! According to SingleCare, the average price for insulin per month is over $1000. Insurance can also run about $550 per month. Planting trees in your area not only helps preserve the natural scenery, but also reduces the severity of soil erosion. Trees can be easily planted by social communities around the world, all you need are trees, volunteers, and 30 minutes of your time. <br> </ul>
Recycling tree and wood related products enables harvested wood to be used over and over again. A tree product’s lifespan can now be multiplied by nearly seven fold, reducing the product’s overall cost while saving the environment. <br> <br>
The reduced use of firewood can cut out a large portion of unneeded deforestation. If people opt for alternatives such as electrical or gas operated heating elements, nearly 10 billion cubic feet of wood can be saved. <br> <br>
Eco-friendly practices help reduce the amount of trees cut down. If everyone makes small behavioral changes in their day-to-day lives, the environmental impacts of deforestation can be lessened. <br> <br>
By raising awareness to the issue of deforestation, people around the world who were once oblivious to this issue can join forces and help fight this modern problem. Fundraisers and social change movements not only relieve the current need for reform, but also provide a cleaner and better Earth. <br><br>
